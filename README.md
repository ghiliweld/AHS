# AHS
The Address Handle Service (AHS) - A Simple ENS Alternative

This is a simple alternative to ENS I made cause ENS was too complicated
for me to understand which seemed odd since it should be simple in my opinion.

**AHS is super simple.**

There are two components to an AHS handle: the *base* and the *handle*.

### Bases
Base names are the components at the end of an AHS handle, like `eth` or `weld**(mine)`. You can buy any base anytime you want as long as it hasn't been registered already. Registering a base costs 100 DAI(100 USD) or roughly 100 USD for of ETH. The price is high for now to test demand, it will likely be decreased significantly in the near future and will be the *only thing* that costs money in the AHS. Ownership of a base can be transferred to anybody.

`eth` is owned by me, but anybody can register a `eth` handle *for free*.

### Handles
Handles are the components at the beginning of an AHS handle, like `ghiliweld` or `vitalik`. Handles correspond to Ethereum addresses, which you can assign however you want. You can register any handle for a `eth` base for free as long as it hasn't been registered already and you can register any handle for any base you own for free.

You can register `myname.eth` for free and as quickly as the transaction can be mined, no auctions and no middleman.
You can register `myname.mybase`, `mymomsname.mybase` and `mydog.mybase` for only the cost of registering `mybase`.
